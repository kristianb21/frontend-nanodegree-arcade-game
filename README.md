How to play:
You may begin playing on page load. Use the arrow keys to move your
player per cell block across the canvas to collect special items without
getting caught by the Enemy.

Points:
Some items are worth more than others, varing 10 - 20 points.
If you reach the water you get 1 point.
It takes 50 or more to win.

You have 3 lives. Enjoy!
